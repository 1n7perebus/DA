                        Robert is a 34-year-old analyst from the United States, whose unique background bridges both technology and psychology. His journey began in the world of design, earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Industrial Design with a specialization in Automotive Design. Later drawn to technology, he became a full-stack software developer proficient in Python, JavaScript, Solidity, and various other technologies. His technical portfolio includes mobile apps, web applications, and Web3/blockchain projects.

                        While coding fulfills his technical curiosity, it was a deeper fascination with the human mind that truly shaped his path.

                        As an INTP personality type—naturally curious and analytical—these qualities led him to an unexpected but life-changing interest in psychology. It began with an elective university course that introduced him to philosophical and psychological thinkers like Kant, Descartes, Nietzsche, and Freud. However, it was Carl Jung's work that truly resonated with him. Jung's theories on the unconscious, archetypes, and personality types struck a chord, giving him language for things he had always sensed but couldn't quite articulate.

                        Over the past eight years, Robert has immersed himself in Jungian psychology, exploring concepts like the Ego, Shadow, Anima/Animus, and the Collective Unconscious. Jung's work on dream analysis, in particular, became a cornerstone of his personal development. Through interpreting his own dreams, he uncovered insights that shifted his perspective on himself and the human psyche in profound ways.

                        His dedication to psychology is deeply personal. At age 13, Robert lost his father to suicide—a traumatic event that spurred existential crises and a determination to understand the complexities of mental health. Through his research, Jung's work provided not only clarity but also a pathway toward healing and personal growth. This process of self-discovery has empowered him to help others in their own journeys.

                        Today, Robert uses his knowledge of Jungian psychology to help individuals around the world explore their inner selves. Through dream analysis and one-on-one counseling, he guides people to uncover the deeper meanings in their lives, providing insights that lead to growth, healing, and greater self-awareness.

Robert's passion is now centered on helping others navigate their own inner worlds, using the universal language of dreams and the transformative power of psychological insight.
